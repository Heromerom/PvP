`$pvp` when the member is not verified. Buttons can **only** be pressed by the user who activated the modal.

### Modals
> This section may change eventually because players would have to verify for other game modes not only PvP. The only thing that would change is the title.

**Verify 1** - Javascript: https://github.com/Heromerom/PvP/blob/main/Verify_1.js

1. **Verify my account** - will update the embed, asking the member to look at his/her DMs. 
2. **Ask for help** - will let the bot tag **Hero PvP Helpers**. *(optional)*

**Verify 2** - Javascript: https://github.com/Heromerom/PvP/blob/main/Verify_2.js
